### Tech Stack for Project
- **Backend**: Python with Flask
- **Frontend**: Jinja2 templates, with potential later use of JavaScript or a frontend framework like React
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for scaling
- **APIs**: Google Calendar API for event dates, Google Maps API for event locations

### Project Focus
- The project will have an even focus on both the frontend and backend. The backend will manage API integrations and data processing, while the frontend will be crucial for displaying information in a user-friendly manner.

### Type of Application
- The project will be developed as a website for broad accessibility and ease of development.

### Project Goal
- To provide an intuitive platform for users to discover events in their area, utilizing data on dates and locations from Google's APIs.

### User Demographic
- Individuals looking for local events, ranging from professionals wanting to explore their surroundings to tourists seeking events in their travel destinations.

### Data Usage and Collection
- Data on events, including dates, times, and locations, will be collected via Google APIs, either in real-time or cached as appropriate to manage performance and adhere to API rate limits.

### Project Approach
- **API Integration**: Start with integrating Google APIs, understanding their data structure and rate limits.
- **Backend Development**: Develop the Flask application to handle requests, process API data, and serve it to the frontend.
- **Database Implementation**: Use SQLite for caching data, with a plan to migrate to PostgreSQL if scaling is required.
- **Frontend Development**: Design the user interface using Jinja2 templates, considering the introduction of JavaScript for dynamic content.
- **Security and Compliance**: Implement necessary security measures, including OAuth for API requests, and ensure compliance with Google API policies.
- **Testing and Deployment**: Conduct thorough testing and deploy the application on a platform like Heroku for easy access.

This streamlined approach retains the essence of the initial project idea while focusing on achievable goals with a clear path for development and learning.
